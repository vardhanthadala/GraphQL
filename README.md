# üöÄ What is GraphQL?

GraphQL is a **query language for APIs** and a **runtime for executing queries** by using a type system you define for your data.  
It was developed by **Facebook in 2012** and released publicly in **2015**.

## üìå Why GraphQL?

- Eliminates **over-fetching** and **under-fetching** problems in REST.
- Provides a **single endpoint** for flexible queries.
- Lets clients specify **exactly what data they need**.
- Strongly typed schema for better API evolution.

## ‚ö° GraphQL vs REST

| Feature            | REST                         | GraphQL                          |
|--------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Data Fetching**  | Multiple endpoints, may fetch extra data | Single endpoint, client chooses data |
| **Performance**    | Over-fetching / under-fetching common | Optimized queries, no wasted data |
| **Versioning**     | Requires new endpoints       | Schema evolves without breaking    |
| **Flexibility**    | Limited                     | Very flexible query language       |

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Concepts

1. **Schema**  
   - Defines types and relationships between data.  
   - Example:
     ```graphql
     type User {
       id: ID!
       name: String!
       email: String!
     }
     ```

2. **Queries**  
   - Used to **fetch data**.  
   - Example:
     ```graphql
     query {
       user(id: 1) {
         name
         email
       }
     }
     ```

3. **Mutations**  
   - Used to **modify data** (create, update, delete).  
   - Example:
     ```graphql
     mutation {
       createUser(name: "Var", email: "var@example.com") {
         id
         name
       }
     }
     ```

4. **Resolvers**  
   - Functions that **map schema fields to data sources**.  
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     const resolvers = {
       Query: {
         user: (_, { id }) => getUserById(id),
       },
     };
     ```

## üåê Example Use Case

- **E-commerce app**  
  Instead of hitting multiple REST endpoints (`/products`, `/reviews`, `/users`),  
  you can fetch all in **one GraphQL query**:
  ```graphql
  query {
    product(id: 101) {
      name
      price
      reviews {
        rating
        comment
        user {
          name
        }
      }
    }
  }


##‚úÖ Advantages of GraphQL

- Flexible and efficient data fetching.

- Strongly typed schema ensures reliability.

- Great developer experience (introspection, tools like GraphiQL).

- Faster development cycles.

  ##‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- Complex setup compared to REST.

- Performance issues if queries are not optimized.

- Requires a learning curve.

- Caching is more challenging than REST.

  ##üèÅ Conclusion

- GraphQL is a modern alternative to REST APIs, offering flexibility, performance, and better developer experience.
- If your app requires dynamic and complex data fetching, GraphQL is a great choice.
